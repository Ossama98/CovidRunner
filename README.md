# CovidRunner

### Presentation
CovidRunner is a game where the main goal is to finish a map(only one was created) without getting infected by any virus.
The player is a person(a box) who tries to avoid any contact with viruses(spheres).

### How to play:
    Press space to see the player(currently just a box) running.
    Press q to go to the left.
    Press d to go to the right.
    Unmute the microphone icon in the top left of the screen to listen to a background music.
    Press p to pause/start a background music.

### Adjustements:
    The player speed can be changed easily in the code to make the game harder/easier (playerSpeed attribute)

### Further improvements:
    The player takes vaccines from the ground and shoots fire/vaccin into the viruses to eradicate them.
    The player and viruses can be 3D models instead of a box and spheres.
    The player can jump over a virus.
    The player can take a mask from the ground and if so the viruses become harmless for some seconds.
    Maybe make the game a multiplayer game in the second semester course ... It can be like a survival race between 
    two players or the player who eradicates more viruses in a limited time wins ...
